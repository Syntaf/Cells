Cells
=====

Cells is a cellular automaton program. It was inspired by Conway's Game of Life (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), and supports a total of 2^18 unique rule sets.

More information about CA can be found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton


Features
--------

* Customizable rule sets (done)
* Copying/pasting with a selection box (done, not committed)
* Customizable color palette (planned)
* GUI for changing settings (planned)
* And many more...

I will be posting more documentation in the upcoming weeks as more features are implemented.


Installation Instructions
-------------------------

This should be as simple as extracting an archive and running the program, as soon as builds are released.
Otherwise, you can compile the code yourself using a recent version of GCC or another C++11 compliant compiler.


Code
----

The code is written in C++11, and uses SFML 2.1 (https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML).

The code is licensed under the GPLv3 license. See LICENSE.txt for more details.
